# API Exercise

## Cell Society and Critique of API

For Team 24, in the modelController we found nine methods that were internal to the front end. Init, and update Cell methods proved external and communcating with the back end of the system. 

## Overall plan for SLogo

Work is currently split among two party lines

### Front-End:
Kayla Schulz kms114
George Bernard ghb5

### Back-End:
Matthew Faw mcf28
Hannah Fuchshuber hpf3

## One Page Description for each of your APIs

Current strategy is to seperate and develop APIs and come back after fall break to determine external APIs
